<li><h3>Icon Exhibit and Open House</h3>
A Parish Open House to invite the public in to see our new iconography will be held August 19-22.  The exhibit will also feature some rare and antique icons from the collections of parishioners.  This open house will be the same weekend as Bishop Melchisedek's visit to our parish to bless the new iconography in the church nave on Sunday, August 22, immediately following the Divine Liturgy.  The Exhibit will run:  Friday, August 20, 10am-5pm;  Saturday, August 21, 10am-6pm; Sunday, August 22, Noon-5pm.  A team of volunteers is needed to cover all the times of the Exhibit.  We want at least 4 volunteers in the building at all times to welcome guests, to help oversee the event and to watch over the icons.  If you are willing to work at this event, please see Fr. Ted.</li>

<br><li><h3>Nominees for Parish Positions in 2011</h3>

<li><h3>Farewell to the Watt Family</h3>
Sunday, June 27th, marks our final Sunday with the Watt family.  Dn. Marty and his family are moving to South Canaan, PA, where Dn. Marty becomes a seminary student this fall.  He is preparing to become ordained as a priest in order to serve the Orthodox Church in that capacity.  To say our goodbyes and thank them for all the work they have done for our parish through ministry, education, and Christian example, we will be having a parish potluck.  Also, this year our June charity collection will be given as a gift to the Watt family.  If you would like to make a contribution to the parish's seminary fund to help support the Watt family during their 3 years at seminary, you can make a check payable to St. Paul Church and note on it "Watt Seminary Fund" so that it gets credited to the proper account.</li>
