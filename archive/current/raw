We are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, you are God's building.
According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master
builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each
one take heed how he builds on it. For no other foundation can anyone lay
than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on thi=
s
foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one's
work will become manifest; for the Day will declare it, because it will be
revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one's work, of what sort it
is. If anyone's work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a
reward. If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself wil=
l
be saved, yet so as through fire. Do you not know that you are the temple o=
f
God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple
of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple
you are.

*GOSPEL:
   Matthew 14:22-34*

Then Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the
other side, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismissed the
crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, h=
e
was there alone, but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from
the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them. And in the
fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But when the
disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, "It is a
ghost!" And they cried out for fear.  But immediately he spoke to them,
saying, "Take heart, it is I; have no fear." And Peter answered him, "Lord,
if it is you, bid me come to you on the water." He said, "Come." So Peter
got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; but when he
saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, sav=
e
me." Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him,
"O man of little faith, why did you doubt?" And when they got into the boat=
,
the wind ceased. And those in the boat  worshiped him, saying, "Truly you
are the Son of God." And when they had crossed over, they came to land at
Gennesaret.

*PETER WALKING ON WATER **One of the most beautiful encounters in the Gospe=
l
takes place between Jesus and Peter on the occasion when Jesus walks on the
water. Peter, sitting in the boat, shouts out into the darkness: =93=91Lord=
, if
it is You, command me to come to You on the water.=92  So, He said, =91Come=
.=92
And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go
to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and
beginning to sink he cried out, saying, =91Lord, save me!=92 And immediatel=
y
Jesus stretched out His* *hand and caught him=94 (Matthew 14:28-31). Peter
relies on Jesus when he initially climbs out of the boat, and again when
Jesus catches him at the end of the story. It is only in the middle, when h=
e
realizes what he is doing, that he relies on his own abilities, and starts
to sink. *(Fr. Meletios Webber, *Steps of Transformation: An Orthodox Pries=
t

Steps<http://www.amazon.com/Steps-Transformation-Orthodox-Priest-Explores/d=

* *

*THE CHURCH BUILT UPON CHRIST* *Thus, the Church is founded on Christ. It i=
s
His Church, the response to His call, the obedience to His will. It is
important to keep this in mind, because Christians themselves often forget
and begin to view the Church as =93theirs,=94 as an organization essentiall=
y
called to serve them, to satisfy their spiritual and non-spiritual needs an=
d
demands. Yet the very word Church shows above all that it is the union of
those who are called to serve Christ, and to continue His work. It is
service not to self but to God. What is this service? Or rather, what is th=
e
purpose, the task for which Christ founded, or as He says, =93built=94 His
Church? The answer to this question is given by the Symbol of faith in the
four adjectives preceding the word =93Church=94: =93I believe,=94 we each s=
ay, =93in
One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.=94* (Alexander Schmemann, *Celebra=
tion

*ST. PAUL: ON THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH **Paul never describes the church=
=92s
mission in terms of a specific task that it is to perform, but in terms of =
a
character of life that it is to exhibit. It is to =91walk worthily of its
call=92 (Eph. 4:1). At the most obvious level, this involves a life of
righteousness before God (Rom. 6:13,18). *(*The Cambridge Companion to St.
Paul<http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Companion-Paul-Companions-Religion/dp/=

* *

*THE SACRED READING OF SCRIPTURE** If you wish to achieve true knowledge of
Scripture you must hurry to achieve unshakable humility of heart=85Then,
having banished all worldly concerns and thoughts, strive in every way to
devote yourself constantly to the sacred reading so that continuous
meditation will seep into your soul and, as it were, will shape it to its
image. Somehow it will form that =91ark=92 of the Scriptures (cf. Heb 9:4-5=
) and
will contain the two stone tablets, that is, the perpetual strength of the
two testaments. There will be the golden urn which is a pure and unstained
memory and which will preserve firmly within itself the everlasting manna,
that is the eternal, heavenly sweetness of spiritual meaning and of that
bread which belongs to the angels=85Therefore the sequences of holy Scriptu=
re
must be committed to memory and they must be pondered ceaselessly. Such
meditation will profit us in two ways. First, when the thrust of the mind i=
s
occupied by the study and perusal of the readings it will, of necessity,
avoid being taken over by the snares of dangerous thoughts. Second, as we
strive with constant repetition to commit these readings to memory, we have
not the time to understand them because our minds have been occupied. But
later when we are free from the attractions of all that we do and see and,
especially, when we are quietly meditating during the hours of darkness, we
think them over and we understand them more closely. And so it happens that
when we are at ease and when, as it were, we are plunged into the dullness
of sleep, the hidden meanings, of which we were utterly unaware during our
waking hours, and the sense of them are bared to our minds.* (John Cassian,

*Icon Exhibit:**     The Gift of Transfiguration: Changed Life and Lives*

Representing more than five centuries of a unique artistic tradition, St.
Paul The Apostle Orthodox Christian Church will be hosting an exhibition of
more than 100 icons, both ancient and new, on display in its sanctuary,
located at 4451 Wagner Road in Sugarcreek Township, August 20-22, 2010.  Th=
e
exhibition is free and open to the public from 10 AM to 6 PM  on Friday,
August 20th  and Saturday,  August 21, and from 12- 5 PM on Sunday, August
22.



We sincerely hope you will be able to join us.



The exhibition entitled =93 The Gift of Transfiguration: Changed Life and
Lives=94 features 40 historic icons, dating from 1650 to the present, from
Russia, Greece, Ukraine, Ethiopia as well as the United States. Among the
treasures, taken from private collections (and on public display for the
first time in Ohio) are a 17th century Russian miniature iconstasis, or
=93icon screen=94 with more than 20 individual figures, as well as a large =
18th
century Icon of the Virgin Mary entitled =93 The Joy of All Who Sorrow=94.



The  historic icons will be surrounded by 36 large icons recently installed
on the walls of St. Paul=92s, commissioned by the parish from noted
Russian-American iconographer Dmitri Shkolnik. Born in Moscow, now based in
San Francisco,  Shkolnik=92s original icons for St. Pauls=92 detail scenes =
from
the life of Christ, the life of St. Paul, as well saints of the 20th centur=
y
- including several martyrs from the Midwest who were executed in Russia fo=
r
their faith during the years of Soviet oppression.



 In keeping with the theme, =93The Gift of Transfiguration: Changed Life an=
d
Lives=94, the exhibition concludes with a number of recent icons by Daryl
Cochran, an American iconographer who is currently an inmate at the London
Correctional Institute in London, OH.  Daryl became an Orthodox Christian a
few years ago while in prison. A talented artist, Daryl is in the process o=
f
becoming a unique iconographer as well.



The exhibition will take place during a weekend of celebration that will
also see a visit by the Orthodox Bishop of Pittsburgh to bless and
consecrate the parish=92s new icons. His Grace, Bishop Melchizedek (Pleska)=
 of
Pittsburgh, a native Daytonian, will preside at a choral vespers on Saturda=
y
evening, August 21, at 7 PM at St. Paul=92s. That same evening at 8 PM the
Bishop will offer a reflection on the meaning of icons, followed by  a smal=
l
reception. On Sunday August 22, the Bishop will celebrate the Divine Liturg=
y
of St. John Chrysostom at 9:30 AM, followed by a service of blessing for th=
e
new icons at 11:00 AM, and a reception in the parish hall at 11:30 AM.  We
would welcome all to join us for services as well.

 to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismiss=

came, he was there alone, but the boat by this time was many furlongs dista=

n the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But wh=

quot;It is a ghost!&quot; And they cried out for fear. =A0But immediately h=

 Peter answered him, &quot;Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the wa=

ed on the water and came to Jesus; but when he saw the wind, he was afraid,=
 and beginning to sink he cried out, &quot;Lord, save me.&quot; Jesus immed=

u wish to achieve true knowledge of Scripture you must hurry to achieve uns=
hakable humility of heart=85Then, having banished all worldly concerns and =
thoughts, strive in every way to devote yourself constantly to the sacred r=
eading so that continuous meditation will seep into your soul and, as it we=
re, will shape it to its image. Somehow it will form that =91ark=92 of the =
Scriptures (cf. Heb 9:4-5) and will contain the two stone tablets, that is,=
 the perpetual strength of the two testaments. There will be the golden urn=
 which is a pure and unstained memory and which will preserve firmly within=
 itself the everlasting manna, that is the eternal, heavenly sweetness of s=
piritual meaning and of that bread which belongs to the angels=85Therefore =
the sequences of holy Scripture must be committed to memory and they must b=
e pondered ceaselessly. Such meditation will profit us in two ways. First, =
when the thrust of the mind is occupied by the study and perusal of the rea=
dings it will, of necessity, avoid being taken over by the snares of danger=
ous thoughts. Second, as we strive with constant repetition to commit these=
 readings to memory, we have not the time to understand them because our mi=
nds have been occupied. But later when we are free from the attractions of =
all that we do and see and, especially, when we are quietly meditating duri=
ng the hours of darkness, we think them over and we understand them more cl=
osely. And so it happens that when we are at ease and when, as it were, we =
are plunged into the dullness of sleep, the hidden meanings, of which we we=
re utterly unaware during our waking hours, and the sense of them are bared=
