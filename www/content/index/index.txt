### Weekly Study Groups ###
The Sunday evening group (5 PM at the church) will be beginning to discuss
David Bell's book *Many Mansions: An Introduction to the Development and
Diversity of Medieval Theology* in mid January. Copies are now available from
Fr. Ted (cost is $23.) The Wednesday morning group (11 AM at the church)  is
reading Etienne Charpentier's *How To Read the New Testament*.

On Sunday mornings during Fellowship hour a group of those with a special
interest in raising children in the Orthodox Faith meets to share questions and
experiences, and is reading and discussing *Walking in Wonder: Nurturing
Orthodox Christian Values in Your Children*.

The Sunday evening group (5 PM at the church) is just finishing *A Cloud of
Witnesses by David Bell*, which surveys history and doctrine of the early
Christian church.

Those interested in a close reading of passages from each Sunday's Epistle
lessons are invited to the 10 Minute Study Group right after Liturgy. We
include some material from commentaries and look at a few relevant Greek words.

A new small group study of the materials from last winter's Called and Gifted
Workshop is just organizing. See Fr. Ted or Laura Short if you are interested.
