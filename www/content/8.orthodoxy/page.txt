####What do Orthodox Christians believe?

As Orthodox Christians have been saying for over fifteen centuries...
>I believe in one God,
>The Father Almighty,
>Maker of Heaven and earth,
>and of all things visible and invisible;
>
>And in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
>the Son of God,
>the Only-begotten,
>Begotten of the Father before all ages,
>Light of Light,
>True God of True God,
>Begotten, not made;
>of one essence with the Father,
>by Whom all things were made:
>Who for us men and for our salvation
>He came down from Heaven,
>and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit
>and the Virgin Mary,
>and became man;
>and was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate
>and suffered and was buried;
>And the third day He rose again
>according to the Scriptures;
>And ascended into heaven
>and is seated at the right hand of the Father;
>He shall come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
>Whose kingdom will have no end.
>
>And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life,
>Who proceeds from the Father,
>Who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified.
>Who spoke by the Prophets.
>
>And I believe in One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.
>I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
>I look for the resurrection of the dead,
>and the life of the world to come.
>Amen.

####What does "Orthodox" mean?####

The word Orthodox means "right teaching" or "right worship".
It's derived from two Greek words: orthos, "right," and
doxa, "teaching" or "worship." The term "Orthodox" came to
be applied to the Church as false teaching and division
multiplied in early Christian times threatening the identity
and purity of the Faith. The Orthodox Church carefully
guards the truth against all lies and error in order to
protect its flock and to glorify Christ. The Orthodox Church
is the "My Church" Christ talked about.

####How can I learn more about Orthodoxy?####

Taste and see. Come and worship with us in the Divine
Liturgy. Don't just come once, as Orthodox worship is deep
and rich, rooted in Holy Scripture and twenty centuries of
Holy Tradition--it's a lot to absorb in just one visit. Come
worship with us for a month. Join us for Fellowship Hour
after the liturgy and ask our members about their journey to
Orthodoxy. Many (if not most) of us at St. Paul's are
converts. If you are interested in but unfamiliar with
Orthodoxy, this is a good parish in which to get your feet
wet.
